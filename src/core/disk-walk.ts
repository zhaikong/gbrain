/**
 * Recursive filesystem walk into a slug → Stats map.
 *
 * Replaces per-page `existsSync` + `statSync` syscall storms (Issue #14 of
 * the v0.22.3 eng review). On a 200K-page brain the per-page approach was
 * 400K syscalls in a synchronous loop; this walk is one syscall per directory
 * plus one stat per file, then O(1) Map lookups for everything downstream.
 *
 * The slug key is the on-disk path relative to the brain repo, with the
 * trailing `.md` stripped, matching how pages are stored: `people/alice.md`
 * on disk becomes `people/alice` as a slug.
 *
 * Skipped entries:
 *   - `.git/`, `node_modules/`, and dot-directories generally — not part of
 *     the brain's page namespace. Speeds up walks significantly on dirty
 *     working copies.
 *   - Files that don't end in `.md`. Sidecar JSON, raw binary attachments,
 *     etc. are tracked by the brain but not via slugs.

 * Walk `repoPath` and return a Map of slug → file metadata for every `.md`
