/**
 * Lease-based rate limiter for outbound providers (e.g. anthropic:messages).
 *
 * Counter-based limiters leak capacity when a worker crashes mid-call
 * (counter never decrements). Leases are owner-tagged rows with an expires_at
 * timestamp — crash recovery is free: any row past expires_at is considered
 * dead on the next acquire and pruned before the active-count check.
 *
 * Two-phase acquire:
 *   1. Pre-prune: DELETE expired leases for this key (same txn).
 *   2. Check-then-insert under a txn-scoped advisory lock so two concurrent
 *      acquires can't both see "one slot left".
 *
 * The owner is always a Minion job id; the lease is CASCADE-tied to
 * minion_jobs so an out-of-band row DELETE (prune, cancel) doesn't leave
 * stale leases. Mid-call renewal bumps expires_at in-place.
