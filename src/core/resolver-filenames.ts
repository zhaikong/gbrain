 * gbrain-native convention: `RESOLVER.md`. OpenClaw convention (per
 * essay referenced in CLAUDE.md): `AGENTS.md`. Both are valid at the
 * same path (skills dir or workspace root for the OpenClaw layout).
 * When both exist at a location, `RESOLVER.md` wins by policy —
 * gbrain-native precedence keeps gbrain's own repo unaffected.
 *
 * One source of truth. Imported by `repo-root.ts` (auto-detect) and
 * `check-resolvable.ts` (parser + error messages). Never hardcode
 * `RESOLVER.md` in new code — import from here.
