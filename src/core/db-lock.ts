/**
 * Generic DB-backed lock primitive.
 *
 * Reuses the gbrain_cycle_locks table (id PK + holder_pid + ttl_expires_at)
 * with a parameterized lock id. Both `gbrain-cycle` (the broad cycle lock)
 * and `gbrain-sync` (performSync's writer lock) live here.
 *
 * Why not pg_advisory_xact_lock: it is session-scoped, and PgBouncer
 * transaction pooling drops session state between calls. This row-based
 * lock survives PgBouncer because it's plain INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE with
 * a TTL fallback (a crashed holder's row times out).
 *
 * Why a separate table-row per lock id rather than reusing the cycle lock:
 * the cycle lock is broader (covers every phase). performSync's write-window
 * is narrower. If performSync reused the cycle lock and the cycle handler
 * called performSync, the inner acquire would deadlock against itself. Two
 * lock ids let callers nest cleanly: cycle holds gbrain-cycle for its run;
 * performSync (called from anywhere — cycle, jobs handler, CLI) takes
 * gbrain-sync just for the write window.
 *
 * v0.22.13 — added in PR #490 to fix CODEX-2 (no cross-process lock for
 * direct sync paths). The cycle path was already protected.
