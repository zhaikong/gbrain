/**
 * Shared concurrency policy for sync + import + jobs paths.
 *
 * Three callers used to embed three different policies:
 *   - performSync (incremental): >100 files → 4 workers
 *   - performFullSync: Postgres → 4 workers
 *   - jobs.ts sync handler: hardcoded 4
 *
 * They drift over time and confuse users ("why does my sync not parallelize?"
 * is a different answer in each path). This module is one source of truth.
 *
 * v0.22.13 — extracted as part of the parallel-sync hardening (PR #490).

 *   - PGLite → always 1 (the engine is single-connection regardless)
 *   - explicit override → respect it (clamped to >=1)
 *   - auto path → DEFAULT_PARALLEL_WORKERS when fileCount > AUTO_CONCURRENCY_FILE_THRESHOLD, else 1

 * Note: this function does NOT consult PARALLEL_FILE_FLOOR. The floor is a
 * caller-side gate that decides whether to take the parallel code path even
 * when the worker count is > 1. It only applies to the auto path; explicit
 * --workers bypasses the floor entirely (per Q1 in PR #490).
