/**
 * v0.18.0 Step 7 — phase B storage backfill loader.
 *
 * Drives the `file_migration_ledger` state machine forward:
 *
 *   pending → copy_done → db_updated → complete
 *
 * Each per-file transition is a separate transaction so a crash
 * between states leaves a recoverable row (resume-on-partial). The
 * ledger is the atomicity backstop for non-atomic object-storage
 * "renames" (S3/Supabase = copy+delete).
 *
 * Crash-point recovery:
 *   - crash AFTER copy, BEFORE DB update → re-run detects
 *     `status='copy_done'`, completes DB update (copy is idempotent
 *     against S3 overwrite so re-copy on same path is fine).
 *   - crash AFTER DB update, BEFORE ledger mark → re-run detects
 *     `status='db_updated'`, marks `complete`.
 *   - crash AFTER ledger mark, BEFORE old-object delete → delete runs
 *     in the explicit "cleanup" sub-phase so old objects are
 *     preserved until a separate operator decision.
 *
 * Scope: v0.18.0 Step 7 DOES rewrite storage_path in the files table
 * and copies the bytes to the new source-prefixed path. It does NOT
 * delete the old objects — that's reserved for a later release once
 * operators have had time to verify the new paths. Old and new
 * objects coexist during the soak period.
