# Weekly Sync — March 28, 2025

Date: March 28, 2025
Format: Internal weekly sync
Duration: 45 minutes

## Topics Covered

### NovaMind Follow-Up

Sarah Chen confirmed the seed round closed today. $4M led by Threshold Ventures with
Marcus Reid taking a board seat. She is moving to hiring mode immediately. Discussed
potential introductions to senior engineers in our network with distributed systems
backgrounds.

NovaMind is on track for Q3 2025 launch with 2 enterprise design partners already
signed in procurement vertical. The 94% task completion rate from Demo Day has held up
in continued testing.

### Threshold Ventures Partnership

Marcus Reid has been responsive and collaborative. He expressed interest in seeing
other AI infrastructure companies. Threshold's thesis around agent-native enterprise
software aligns well with several companies in the current YC batch and recent alumni.

### GBrain Search Quality

Current keyword-only search is missing relevant results when queries use different
terminology than stored documents. Example: searching "autonomous agents" does not
surface pages about "AI agents" or "agentic systems." Need semantic similarity via
vector embeddings.

Discussed hybrid search approach: combine vector similarity search with keyword
full-text search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). This would handle both exact
keyword matches and semantic near-matches. Priya Patel's NovaMind architecture is a
good case study — searching for "multi-agent coordination" should surface her page
even if those exact words are not in every mention.

## Key Decisions

- Ship hybrid search in GBrain v0.3. This is the highest priority feature.
- Use pgvector for embeddings, stored alongside content in Postgres.
- Adopt Reciprocal Rank Fusion to merge vector and keyword result sets.
- Continue tracking NovaMind progress for potential deeper engagement.

## Action Items

- [ ] Implement pgvector extension and embedding storage in GBrain schema
- [ ] Build hybrid search with RRF scoring in GBrain v0.3
- [x] Follow up with Sarah Chen on seed round status — confirmed closed
- [ ] Send Marcus Reid list of AI infrastructure companies from recent batches
- [ ] Write compiled-truth page for hybrid search concept
- [ ] Schedule technical deep dive with Priya Patel on multi-agent systems

## Timeline

### 2025-03-28 — Meeting Notes

Productive sync. The GBrain search discussion was the most substantive — we identified
clear failure cases with keyword-only search and agreed on the hybrid approach. The
NovaMind seed closing is good news and validates the W25 batch quality. Marcus Reid
continues to be a strong partner in the AI investment ecosystem. Next weekly sync
scheduled for April 4.
