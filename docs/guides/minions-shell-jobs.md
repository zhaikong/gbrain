# Minions shell jobs — move deterministic crons off the gateway

## 30 seconds

```bash
# Run your first shell job:
GBRAIN_ALLOW_SHELL_JOBS=1 gbrain jobs submit shell \
  --params '{"cmd":"echo hello","cwd":"/tmp"}' --follow
# → exit_code: 0, stdout_tail: "hello\n", duration_ms: 43
```

That's it. Your cron scripts now have a home with retry, backoff, DLQ, and
`gbrain jobs list` visibility, without each one booting a full LLM session.

**PGLite users:** `gbrain jobs work` does not run on PGLite (exclusive file
lock). Every crontab invocation must use `--follow` for inline execution.
Postgres users can run a persistent worker; see recipes below.

## Why it exists

If your agent runs deterministic scripts from cron (token refresh, API fetch,
scrape + write), each one pays the cost of a full LLM session on the gateway.
Fourteen simultaneous fires on a Series A deployment pin CPU at 100% and block
live messages. None of those scripts need reasoning. They need a shell.

Shell jobs move them to the Minions worker: one deterministic-script execution
per cron, zero LLM tokens, unified visibility and retry.

## Security model (read this)

Shell exec is a large blast radius. We ship two independent gates, both must
pass:

1. **MCP boundary.** `submit_job` with `name: 'shell'` is rejected when
   `ctx.remote === true` (MCP callers). Independent of the env flag. Remote
   agents can never submit shell jobs. `MinionQueue.add('shell', ...)` has its
   own guard too, so an in-process handler can't programmatically bypass this.
2. **Env flag.** The worker only registers the shell handler when
   `GBRAIN_ALLOW_SHELL_JOBS=1` is set on the worker process. Default: off. Your
   agent opts in per-host.

**What the env allowlist does AND does not do.** Shell jobs run with a minimal
env: `PATH, HOME, USER, LANG, TZ, NODE_ENV`. Your secrets like `OPENAI_API_KEY`
and `DATABASE_URL` are NOT passed to the child. You opt-in additional keys per
job via `env: { ... }`. This stops accidental `$OPENAI_API_KEY` interpolation in
a user-authored script. It does **not** sandbox filesystem reads: a shell
script can `cat ~/.env` or any file the worker process can read. The operator
picks a safe `cwd`. That is the trust boundary.

**Audit trail, not forensic insurance.** Every submission writes a JSONL line
to `~/.gbrain/audit/shell-jobs-YYYY-Www.jsonl` (ISO-week rotation; override
with `GBRAIN_AUDIT_DIR`). Failures log to stderr and don't block submission, so
a disk-full adversary could silently disable the trail. Good for "what did
this cron submit last Tuesday", not for security-critical forensics.

**The command text is logged as-is.** If you embed a secret in `cmd`
(`curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer ...'`), it shows up in the audit file. Put
secrets in `env:` instead.

## Migrate a cron

### Postgres worker (recommended)

On one terminal, start a persistent worker:

```bash
GBRAIN_ALLOW_SHELL_JOBS=1 gbrain jobs work
```

Rewrite crontab to submit shell jobs (no `--follow`):

```cron
# Before (LLM gateway):
#   OpenClaw cron: x-garrytan-unified
# After (Minions worker):
3 13,16,19,22,1,4,7,10 * * * \
  gbrain jobs submit shell \
    --params '{"cmd":"node scripts/x-garrytan-daily.mjs","cwd":"/data/.openclaw/workspace"}' \
    --max-attempts 3 --timeout-ms 300000
```

Worker claims the job on next poll, runs it, records `exit_code` +
`stdout_tail` + `stderr_tail` in the result. Failures retry per
`--max-attempts` with exponential backoff.

### PGLite (inline execution)

PGLite doesn't support the persistent worker daemon. Every crontab invocation
uses `--follow` to run inline:

```cron
# Each cron tick spawns a short-lived worker that runs the job inline.
3 13,16,19,22,1,4,7,10 * * * \
  GBRAIN_ALLOW_SHELL_JOBS=1 gbrain jobs submit shell \
    --params '{"cmd":"node scripts/x-garrytan-daily.mjs","cwd":"/data/.openclaw/workspace"}' \
    --follow --timeout-ms 300000
```

Note: `--follow` blocks the crontab slot until the job finishes. If 14 shell
crons land at the same minute and each takes 30s, they serialize through
crontab's spawning limits. Postgres + persistent worker scales better.

### Submitting with `argv` (no shell interpolation)

For programmatic callers assembling commands from JSON, use `argv` instead of
`cmd`. No shell, no injection surface:

```bash
gbrain jobs submit shell \
  --params '{"argv":["node","scripts/fetch.mjs","--date","2026-04-19"],"cwd":"/data"}' \
  --follow
```

---

## Debug a failed job

```bash
# List dead shell jobs
gbrain jobs list --status dead

# Inspect one
gbrain jobs get 42
# → error_text, stacktrace, result.stdout_tail, result.stderr_tail

# Submission audit log (operator trail, not forensic)
cat ~/.gbrain/audit/shell-jobs-*.jsonl | jq '.'

# First-time failure mode: submitted without env flag on the worker
gbrain jobs list --status waiting --name shell
# If rows pile up here, no worker with GBRAIN_ALLOW_SHELL_JOBS=1 is running.
```

## Limitations

- **Filesystem reads are not sandboxed.** See "Security model" above. Don't
  point `cwd` at a directory full of secrets.
- **Audit log is advisory.** Disk-full or EACCES silently disables it.
- **Cancel latency is lock-renewal-bounded** (~7-15 s by default). A cancelled
  child keeps running until the next lock-renewal tick fails.
- **`--follow` claim order** is by priority/created_at. If another job is
  waiting in the same queue at the time of `--follow`, that one runs first.
- **`cwd` symlink TOCTOU.** The absolute-path check doesn't guard against
  symlinks pointing elsewhere at execution time. Operator-scope concern.

## Errors {#errors}

| Error | What it means | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `shell: specify exactly one of cmd or argv` | `cmd` and `argv` are mutually exclusive. Both absent is also invalid. | Choose one. `cmd` for shell-interpolated strings; `argv` for structured args. |
| `shell: cwd is required and must be an absolute path` | `cwd` must be a string starting with `/`. | Set `cwd` in `--params` to an absolute path. |
| `shell: argv must be an array of strings` | `argv` has a non-string entry or isn't an array. | Pass `argv: ["bin","arg1","arg2"]`. |
| `shell: env values must all be strings` | `env` has a number/bool/object value. | Stringify: `"env":{"COUNT":"3"}` not `"env":{"COUNT":3}`. |
| `permission_denied: shell jobs cannot be submitted over MCP` | An MCP client tried to submit a shell job. By design CLI-only. | Submit from CLI or via a trusted operation handler (`ctx.remote === false`). |
| `protected job name 'shell' requires CLI or operation-local submitter` | A caller invoked `MinionQueue.add('shell', ...)` without the `trusted` opt-in. | Pass `{ allowProtectedSubmit: true }` as the 4th arg. CLI and `submit_job` do this automatically. |
| `aborted: timeout` / `aborted: cancel` / `aborted: shutdown` / `aborted: lock-lost` | The worker's abort signal fired mid-execution. Child got SIGTERM, 5s grace, then SIGKILL. | Expected: timeout / user cancel / deploy restart / stall. Inspect `gbrain jobs get` to see which. |
| `exit N: <stderr_tail_500>` | Script exited non-zero. | Read `stderr_tail` in `gbrain jobs get`. |
