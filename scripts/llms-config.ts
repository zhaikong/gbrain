 * llms-config — single source of truth for llms.txt + llms-full.txt.
 *
 * Consumed by scripts/build-llms.ts (emits llms.txt, llms-full.txt) and
 * test/build-llms.test.ts (asserts paths resolve, content contract holds).
 *
 * Adding a doc? Add it here and run `bun run build:llms`. The drift-detection
 * test fails CI if you forget.
 *
 * Fork-friendliness: `rawBaseUrl` reads from `LLMS_REPO_BASE` so forks can
 * regenerate without manual URL rewrites:
 *   LLMS_REPO_BASE=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fork-org/gbrain/main bun run build:llms
