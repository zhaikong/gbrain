# Run E2E tests ONE FILE AT A TIME.
#
# Bun's default is to run test files in parallel (each in its own worker).
# Our E2E suite shares one Postgres database across all 13 files, and
# `setupDB()` does TRUNCATE CASCADE + fixture import. When files run in
# parallel, file A's TRUNCATE can race with file B's fixture import,
# producing observed fails like "expected 16 pages, got 8", missing
# links, orphaned timeline entries, etc. The flakiness was visible on
# ~3 of every 5 runs pre-fix.
#
# Running files sequentially eliminates the race entirely. It also costs
# some startup overhead (each file spins up a fresh bun process) but for
# a suite this size that is measured in ~1-2s per file, amortized under
# the natural per-file test time of 5-10s.
#
# Exits non-zero on the first failing file so CI fails fast.
#
# `--timeout=60000` matches the unit test suite. Bun's default is 5s,
# which is too tight for setupDB's TRUNCATE CASCADE on ~30 tables on
# CI runners under load (one CI flake observed on PR #475 hitting
# exactly 5000.09ms in the Tags beforeAll).
