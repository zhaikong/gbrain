# drops below the v0.21.0 baseline (17 entries).
#
# Policy (from CLAUDE.md):
#   "Removing any of these is a breaking change going forward."
#
# If you're legitimately removing a public export: bump gbrain's minor
# version, note the removal in CHANGELOG.md under a "Breaking changes"
# bullet, then bump EXPECTED_COUNT below. Anything else is a regression.
#
# Adding a new export: update EXPECTED_COUNT to match AND extend the
# EXPECTED_EXPORTS list in test/public-exports.test.ts so the runtime
# contract test pins the canary symbol.
