# CI guard: fail if any new code emits \r-progress to stdout.
#
# Since v0.14.2, bulk-action progress lives on stderr via the shared
# src/core/progress.ts reporter. \r-rewriting on stdout breaks every
# piped-output scenario: agents that capture stdout for structured
# results see progress garbage mixed with the data, and CI logs show
# a single line per command because everything after the last \r
# is truncated by the terminal emulator when played back.
#
# This script greps for the anti-pattern. Legitimate uses of \r inside
# string literals (e.g. Windows line-ending normalization, regex
# patterns) are expected to contain \r without being preceded by
# `process.stdout.write`. We match the full write-call form only.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-progress-to-stdout.sh
# Exit:  0 when clean, 1 when a banned pattern is found.
