# CI guard against silent singleton reuse in connected-gbrains code paths.
#
# Codex finding #7 (plan review 2026-04-22): the module singleton in
# src/core/db.ts is shared across the process. With multi-brain routing,
# any `db.getConnection()` call in an op-dispatch code path means that op
# silently targets whichever brain connected to the singleton first,
# regardless of ctx.brainId / ctx.engine. This is exactly the bug Codex
# #1 flagged in postgres-engine.ts internals.
#
# This script fails the build when NEW `db.getConnection()` calls appear
# in src/core/operations.ts (the per-op handler surface) or in any new
# `src/commands/*.ts` file. Existing legitimate callers are grandfathered
# via an explicit allowlist — cleanups land in PR 1.
#
# When you hit this guard: instead of `db.getConnection()` or `db.connect(...)`,
# use `ctx.engine` from the passed-in OperationContext. See
# src/core/brain-registry.ts for how ctx.engine gets populated per-call.
#
# Run manually:  bash scripts/check-no-legacy-getconnection.sh
# Wired into CI: `bun test` (via package.json scripts.test)
