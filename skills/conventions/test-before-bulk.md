# Test Before Bulk Convention

Never run a batch operation without testing one first.

## The Process

1. **Read the skill first.** Don't write throwaway scripts. If a skill exists, use it.
2. **Hone the prompt/logic.** Get the output format right before running anything.
3. **Test on 3-5 items.** Run in `--test` mode if available. Don't commit or push.
4. **Check the work yourself.** Read the actual output. Is quality pristine? Titles good? Entities extracted? Back-links created? Format clean?
5. **Fix what's wrong.** Update the skill, not a one-off script. The skill is the durable artifact.
6. **Only then: bulk execute.** With throttling, commits every N items, and a kill switch.

## Why This Matters

One bad bulk run can write 170 mediocre pages that are harder to fix than to do
right the first time. The marginal cost of testing 5 first is near zero. The cost
of cleaning up a bad bulk run is enormous.

## Applies To

- Video/media enrichment batches
- People/company enrichment batches
- Brain backfill operations
- Any cron job being deployed for the first time
- Any new skill being run at scale
- Meeting ingestion batches

## Anti-Patterns

- Writing a bash script from scratch instead of using an existing skill
- Running 170 items without testing 5 first
- Skipping entity propagation "as a separate step"
- Committing bulk work without reading the output
- "I'll fix the quality later"
