# Brain Filing Rules -- MANDATORY for all skills that write to the brain

## The Rule

The PRIMARY SUBJECT of the content determines where it goes. Not the format,
not the source, not the skill that's running.

## Decision Protocol

1. Identify the primary subject (a person? company? concept? policy issue?)
2. File in the directory that matches the subject
3. Cross-link from related directories
4. When in doubt: what would you search for to find this page again?

## Common Misfiling Patterns -- DO NOT DO THESE

| Wrong | Right | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Analysis of a topic -> `sources/` | -> appropriate subject directory | sources/ is for raw data only |
| Article about a person -> `sources/` | -> `people/` | Primary subject is a person |
| Meeting-derived company info -> `meetings/` only | -> ALSO update `companies/` | Entity propagation is mandatory |
| Research about a company -> `sources/` | -> `companies/` | Primary subject is a company |
| Reusable framework/thesis -> `sources/` | -> `concepts/` | It's a mental model |
| Tweet thread about policy -> `media/` | -> `civic/` or `concepts/` | media/ is for content ops |

## Sanctioned exception: synthesis output is sui generis

The "file by primary subject" rule is for raw ingest. Synthesized output that
is one-of-one to a single source AND a specific reader (a personalized book
mirror, a strategic-reading playbook tied to one problem) does not fit any
subject directory cleanly: filing by topic loses the "this is the book"
dimension; filing by author muddles authorship pages with synthesis pages.

Format-prefixed paths under `media/<format>/<slug>` are the sanctioned
exception:

- `media/books/<slug>-personalized.md` (book-mirror output)
- `media/articles/<slug>-personalized.md` (long-form article personalization)

If you find yourself wanting `media/<format>/` for raw ingest, that is still
the anti-pattern in the table above. The exception is narrow: synthesized,
one-of-one, sui generis to a single source.

## What `sources/` Is Actually For

`sources/` is ONLY for:
- Bulk data imports (API dumps, CSV exports, snapshots)
- Raw data that feeds multiple brain pages (e.g., a guest export, contact sync)
- Periodic captures (quarterly snapshots, sync exports)

If the content has a clear primary subject (a person, company, concept, policy
issue), it does NOT go in sources/. Period.

## Notability Gate

Not everything deserves a brain page. Before creating a new entity page:
- **People:** Will you interact with them again? Are they relevant to your work?
- **Companies:** Are they relevant to your work or interests?
- **Concepts:** Is this a reusable mental model worth referencing later?
- **When in doubt, DON'T create.** A missing page can be created later.
  A junk page wastes attention and degrades search quality.

## Iron Law: Back-Linking (MANDATORY)

Every mention of a person or company with a brain page MUST create a back-link
FROM that entity's page TO the page mentioning them. This is bidirectional:
the new page links to the entity, AND the entity's page links back.

Format for back-links (append to Timeline or See Also):
```
- **YYYY-MM-DD** | Referenced in [page title](path/to/page.md) -- brief context
```

An unlinked mention is a broken brain. The graph is the intelligence.

## Citation Requirements (MANDATORY)

Every fact written to a brain page must carry an inline `[Source: ...]` citation.

Three formats:
- **Direct attribution:** `[Source: User, {context}, YYYY-MM-DD]`
- **API/external:** `[Source: {provider}, YYYY-MM-DD]` or `[Source: {publication}, {URL}]`
- **Synthesis:** `[Source: compiled from {list of sources}]`

Source precedence (highest to lowest):
1. User's direct statements (highest authority)
2. Compiled truth (pre-existing brain synthesis)
3. Timeline entries (raw evidence)
4. External sources (API enrichment, web search -- lowest)

When sources conflict, note the contradiction with both citations. Don't
silently pick one.

## Raw Source Preservation

Every ingested item should have its raw source preserved for provenance.

**Size routing (automatic via `gbrain files upload-raw`):**
- **< 100 MB text/PDF**: stays in the brain repo (git-tracked) in a `.raw/`
  sidecar directory alongside the brain page
- **>= 100 MB OR media files** (video, audio, images): uploaded to cloud
  storage (Supabase Storage, S3, etc.) with a `.redirect.yaml` pointer left
  in the brain repo. Files >= 100 MB use TUS resumable upload (6 MB chunks
  with retry) for reliability.

**Upload command:**
```bash
gbrain files upload-raw <file> --page <page-slug> --type <type>
```
Returns JSON: `{storage: "git"}` for small files, `{storage: "supabase", storagePath, reference}` for cloud.

**The `.redirect.yaml` pointer format:**
```yaml
target: supabase://brain-files/page-slug/filename.mp4
bucket: brain-files
storage_path: page-slug/filename.mp4
size: 524288000
size_human: 500 MB
hash: sha256:abc123...
mime: video/mp4
uploaded: 2026-04-11T...
type: transcript
```

**Accessing stored files:**
```bash
gbrain files signed-url <storage-path>    # Generate 1-hour signed URL
gbrain files restore <dir>                # Download back to local
```

This ensures any derived brain page can be traced back to its original source,
and large files don't bloat the git repo.

## Dream-cycle synthesize / patterns directories (v0.23)

The `synthesize` and `patterns` phases of `gbrain dream` write to a
**fixed allow-list** of paths sourced from `_brain-filing-rules.json`'s
`dream_synthesize_paths.globs` array. Editing that JSON is the ONLY way
to add a new directory the synthesis subagent may write to:

| Output type | Slug pattern | What goes here |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Reflection | `wiki/personal/reflections/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-<hash[:6]>` | Self-knowledge, emotional processing, pattern recognition. Verbatim quotes from the user, with analysis. |
| Original idea | `wiki/originals/ideas/YYYY-MM-DD-<idea>-<hash[:6]>` | New frames, theses, mental models, "conceptive ideologist" outputs. Capture the user's exact phrasing — that's the artifact. |
| People enrichment | `wiki/people/<existing-slug>` | Timeline entries appended to existing people pages from session mentions. Stub pages for new substantive people. |
| Pattern | `wiki/personal/patterns/<theme>` | Cross-session theme detected across ≥3 reflections. Highest-leverage output: a pattern can span 25 years if reflections reference dated content. |
| Cycle summary | `dream-cycle-summaries/YYYY-MM-DD` | Index of every page produced by one dream cycle. Auto-written deterministically by the orchestrator. |

**Iron Law for synthesize output:**
1. Quote the user verbatim. Do not paraphrase memorable phrasings.
2. Cross-reference compulsively: every new page MUST link to existing brain content.
3. Slug discipline: lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only, slash-separated. NO underscores, NO file extensions.
4. Edited transcripts produce NEW slugs (content-hash suffix changes) — never silently overwrite a prior reflection.
