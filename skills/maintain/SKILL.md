# Maintain Skill

Periodic brain health checks and cleanup.

## Contract

This skill guarantees:
- All health dimensions are checked (stale, orphan, dead links, cross-refs, backlinks, citations, filing, tags)
- Each issue found has a specific fix action
- Back-link iron law is enforced
- Citation format is validated against the standard
- Results are reported with counts per dimension

## Phases

1. **Run health check.** Check gbrain health to get the dashboard.
2. **Check each dimension:**

### Stale pages
Pages where compiled_truth is older than the latest timeline entry. The assessment hasn't been updated to reflect recent evidence.
- Check the health output for stale page count
- For each stale page: read the page from gbrain, review timeline, determine if compiled_truth needs rewriting

### Orphan pages
Pages with zero inbound links. Nobody references them.
- Review orphans: are they genuinely isolated or just missing links?
- Add links in gbrain from related pages or flag for deletion

### Dead links
Links pointing to pages that don't exist.
- Remove dead links in gbrain

### Missing cross-references
Pages that mention entity names but don't have formal links.
- Read compiled_truth from gbrain, extract entity mentions, create links in gbrain

### Link graph extraction
If link_count is 0 or low relative to page_count, run batch extraction:
```bash
gbrain extract links --dir ~/brain
```
This scans all markdown files for entity references, See Also sections, and
frontmatter fields, then creates typed links in the database.

### Timeline extraction
If timeline_entry_count is 0, extract structured timeline from markdown:
```bash
gbrain extract timeline --dir ~/brain
```

### Dream cycle (v0.23): synthesize + patterns

`gbrain dream` runs the full 8-phase maintenance cycle:

```
lint -> backlinks -> sync -> synthesize -> extract -> patterns -> embed -> orphans
```

The two new phases consolidate yesterday's conversations into long-term memory:

**Synthesize phase:** reads transcripts from `dream.synthesize.session_corpus_dir`,
runs a cheap Haiku verdict (cached in `dream_verdicts`) to filter routine
ops sessions, then fans out one Sonnet subagent per worth-processing
transcript. Each subagent writes reflections (`wiki/personal/reflections/...`),
originals (`wiki/originals/ideas/...`), and people timeline entries. The
orchestrator collects the slugs from `subagent_tool_executions` (NOT
`pages.updated_at` — that would pick up unrelated writes) and reverse-renders
each new page from DB → markdown on disk.

**Patterns phase:** runs after `extract` (so the graph state is fresh).
Reads recent reflections within `dream.patterns.lookback_days` (default 30),
runs a single Sonnet pass to surface recurring themes, and writes pattern
pages to `wiki/personal/patterns/<theme>` when ≥`dream.patterns.min_evidence`
(default 3) reflections support a pattern.

**Quality bar (Iron Law for synthesis):**
1. Quote the user verbatim. Do not paraphrase memorable phrasings.
2. Cross-reference compulsively: every new page MUST have at least one wikilink.
3. Slug discipline: lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only. NO underscores, NO file extensions.
4. Edited transcripts produce NEW slugs (content-hash suffix changes) — never silently overwrite.

**Trust boundary (`allowed_slug_prefixes`):** the synthesis subagent runs with an
explicit allow-list of write paths sourced from `_brain-filing-rules.json`'s
`dream_synthesize_paths.globs`. Even on prompt-injection success, the subagent
cannot write outside that list. Trust comes from PROTECTED_JOB_NAMES — MCP
cannot submit subagent jobs at all. Editing the JSON is the only way to add
a new directory the synthesizer can write to.

**Idempotency + privacy:** transcripts are keyed by `(file_path, content_hash)`,
so re-running on the same content is a no-op. `dream.synthesize.exclude_patterns`
(default `["medical", "therapy"]`) filters out transcripts before any LLM call.
Each entry is auto-wrapped as a word-boundary regex (e.g. `medical` matches
"medical advice" but NOT "comedical"). Power users may pass full regex.

**Cooldown:** the cycle's spend cap. `dream.synthesize.cooldown_hours` (default
12) means at most ~2 synthesize runs per day under autopilot. The completion
timestamp is stored in `dream.synthesize.last_completion_ts` and is written
ONLY on successful runs (not on skipped/failed). Explicit `--input` /
`--date` / `--from` / `--to` invocations bypass cooldown.

**`--dry-run` semantics:** runs the cheap Haiku significance filter (caches
verdicts) but skips the Sonnet synthesis pass. NOT zero LLM calls.

**Configure synthesize on a fresh brain:**
```bash
gbrain config set dream.synthesize.session_corpus_dir /path/to/transcripts
gbrain config set dream.synthesize.enabled true
gbrain dream --phase synthesize --dry-run --json   # preview
gbrain dream                                       # full 8-phase cycle
```

**Invocation patterns:**
```bash
gbrain dream                                          # full cycle
gbrain dream --phase synthesize                       # just synthesize
gbrain dream --phase patterns                         # just patterns
gbrain dream --input ~/transcripts/2026-04-25.txt     # ad-hoc one transcript
gbrain dream --from 2026-04-01 --to 2026-04-25        # backfill range
gbrain dream --json                                   # CycleReport JSON
```

**Auto-commit deferred to v1.1:** v1 writes files to `brain_dir` but does NOT
`git add` / `commit` / `push`. Either commit yourself or let `gbrain autopilot`
handle it.
Parses `- **YYYY-MM-DD** | Source — Summary` and `### YYYY-MM-DD — Title` formats.
Note: extracted entries improve structured queries (`gbrain timeline`), not vector search.

### Autopilot check
Verify autopilot is running:
```bash
gbrain autopilot --status
```
If not running, install it:
```bash
gbrain autopilot --install --repo ~/brain
```
Autopilot runs sync, extract, and embed in a continuous loop with adaptive scheduling.
In v0.11.1+, autopilot dispatches each cycle as a single `autopilot-cycle`
Minion job and supervises the worker child — one install step gives you
sync + extract + embed + backlinks + durable job processing.

### Fix a half-migrated install
A v0.11.0 install where the migration skill never fired leaves Minions
partially set up: schema is applied, but `~/.gbrain/preferences.json`
doesn't exist, autopilot runs inline, host manifests still reference
`agentTurn`. Repair:

```bash
# Check migration status
gbrain apply-migrations --list

# Apply pending migrations (idempotent; safe on healthy installs)
gbrain apply-migrations --yes

# If host-specific handlers are flagged in ~/.gbrain/migrations/pending-host-work.jsonl:
# walk them per skills/migrations/v0.11.0.md + docs/guides/plugin-handlers.md,
# ship handler registrations in the host repo, then re-run apply-migrations.
```

Full troubleshooting guide: `docs/guides/minions-fix.md`.

### Back-link enforcement
Check that the back-linking iron law is being followed:
- For each recently updated page, check if entities mentioned in it have
  corresponding back-links FROM those entity pages
- A mention without a back-link is a broken brain
- Fix: add the missing back-link to the entity's Timeline or See Also section
- Format: `- **YYYY-MM-DD** | Referenced in [page title](path) -- brief context`

### Filing rule violations
Check for common misfiling patterns (see `skills/_brain-filing-rules.md`):
- Content with clear primary subjects filed in `sources/` instead of the
  appropriate directory (people/, companies/, concepts/, etc.)
- Use gbrain search to find pages in `sources/` that reference specific
  people, companies, or concepts -- these may be misfiled
- Flag misfiled pages for review or re-filing

### Citation audit
Spot-check pages for missing `[Source: ...]` citations:
- Read 5-10 recently updated pages
- Check that compiled truth (above the line) has inline citations
- Check that timeline entries have source attribution
- Flag pages where facts appear without provenance

### Tag consistency
Inconsistent tagging (e.g., "vc" vs "venture-capital", "ai" vs "artificial-intelligence").
- Standardize to the most common variant using gbrain tag operations

### Graph population (v0.10.3+)

The `links` and `timeline_entries` tables are the structured graph layer.
Populate them periodically or after major imports:

- `gbrain extract links --source db` — backfill structured links by walking pages
  from the engine. Reads `[Name](people/slug)` / `[Name](companies/slug)` references
  and infers relationship types (`attended`, `works_at`, `invested_in`, `founded`,
  `advises`, `mentions`, `source`). Idempotent. Use `--source fs --dir <brain>`
  if you have a markdown checkout to walk instead.
- `gbrain extract timeline --source db` — backfill structured timeline entries.
  Parses `- **YYYY-MM-DD** | summary` lines from page content. Idempotent (DB
  UNIQUE constraint).
- `gbrain extract all --source db` — both in one run.
- `gbrain graph-query <slug> --depth 2` — verify connectivity (use any well-known
  entity slug as a probe).
- `gbrain stats` — verify `link_count > 0` and `timeline_entry_count > 0` after extraction.
- `gbrain health` — review `link_coverage` and `timeline_coverage` percentages
  on entity pages (person/company). Below 50% means more extraction is needed.

Available link types (use with `gbrain graph-query --type`):
`attended`, `works_at`, `invested_in`, `founded`, `advises`, `mentions`, `source`.

Going forward, every `gbrain put` call auto-creates and reconciles links via the
auto-link post-hook (default on; disable: `gbrain config set auto_link false`).
So link-extract is mostly a one-time backfill. timeline-extract should be re-run
after bulk imports or content edits that add new dated entries.

### Embedding freshness
Chunks without embeddings, or chunks embedded with an old model.
- For large embedding refreshes (>1000 chunks), use nohup:
  `nohup gbrain embed refresh > /tmp/gbrain-embed.log 2>&1 &`
- Then check progress: `tail -1 /tmp/gbrain-embed.log`

### Security (RLS verification)
Run `gbrain doctor --json` and check the RLS status.
All tables should show RLS enabled. If not, run `gbrain init` again.

### Schema health
Check that the schema version is up to date. `gbrain doctor --json` reports
the current version vs expected. If behind, `gbrain init` runs migrations
automatically.

### File storage health
Check the integrity of stored files and redirect pointers:
- Run `gbrain files verify` to check all DB records have valid data
- Run `gbrain files status` to see migration state (local, mirrored, redirected)
- Check for orphan `.redirect.yaml` pointers that reference missing storage files
- Check for large binary files (>= 100 MB) still in git that should be in cloud storage
- If storage backend is configured: verify redirect pointers resolve (download test)

### Open threads
Timeline items older than 30 days with unresolved action items.
- Flag for review

## Benchmark Testing

Periodically verify search quality hasn't regressed. Run a battery of test
queries across difficulty tiers:

- **Tier 1 (entity lookup):** known names -- should always resolve
- **Tier 2 (topic recall):** concepts, topics -- keyword search should handle
- **Tier 3 (semantic):** queries with no exact keyword match -- needs embeddings
- **Tier 4 (cross-domain):** relational/connection queries -- only semantic handles

Compare results from `gbrain search` (keyword) vs `gbrain query` (hybrid).
Quality matters more than speed (2.5s right > 200ms wrong).

When to run benchmarks:
- After major brain imports or re-imports
- After gbrain version upgrades
- After embedding regeneration
- Monthly to track quality drift

## Heartbeat Integration

For production agents running on a schedule, integrate gbrain health checks into
your operational heartbeat.

### On every heartbeat (hourly or per-session)

Run `gbrain doctor --json` and check for degradation. Report any failing checks
to the user. Key signals: connection health, schema version, RLS status, embedding
staleness.

### Weekly maintenance

Run `gbrain embed --stale` to refresh embeddings for pages that have changed since
their last embedding. For large brains (>5000 pages), run this with nohup:
```bash
nohup gbrain embed --stale > /tmp/gbrain-embed.log 2>&1 &
```

### Daily verification

Verify sync is running: check `gbrain stats` and confirm `last_sync` is within
the last 24 hours. If sync has stopped, the brain is drifting from the repo.

### Stale compiled truth detection

Flag pages where compiled truth is >30 days old but the timeline has recent entries.
This means new evidence exists that hasn't been synthesized. These pages need a
compiled truth rewrite (see the maintain workflow above).

## Report Storage

After maintenance runs, save a report:
- Health check results (before/after scores for each dimension)
- Back-link violations found and fixed
- Filing rule violations found
- Citation gaps flagged
- Benchmark results (if run)
- Outstanding issues requiring user attention

This creates an audit trail for brain health over time.

## Quality Rules

- Never delete pages without confirmation
- Log all changes via timeline entries
- Check gbrain health before and after to show improvement

## Anti-Patterns

- Fixing pages without reading them first -- you must understand context before editing
- Silently skipping dimensions -- every dimension must be checked and reported, even if clean
- Deleting orphan pages without checking if they should be linked instead
- Running embedding refresh during peak usage hours
- Batch-fixing back-links without verifying the relationship is real
- Marking a dimension "clean" without actually querying it
- Rewriting compiled truth without reading the full timeline first
- Removing tags without checking if other pages use the same tag consistently

## Output Format

The maintenance report follows this structure:
